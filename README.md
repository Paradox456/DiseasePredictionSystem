# DiseasePredictionSystem

## Overview

The Disease Prediction System is a machine learning application that predicts potential diseases based on user-input symptoms and health metrics. It employs various classification algorithms to analyze the data and provides predictions that can help users make informed health decisions.

## Features
-User-friendly web interface for symptom input.
-Predictive analytics using machine learning models.
-Robust backend built with Flask to handle predictions.
-Option to expand with more complex models and features.

## Technologies Used
- Backend: Python, Flask
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy
- Frontend: React
- Data Storage: CSV files for dataset management
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook for model training and evaluation

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset containing health metrics and symptoms associated with various diseases. The dataset can be found in the 'data/' directory. It is crucial to preprocess this data for effective model training.
